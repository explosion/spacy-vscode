### Hover

The hover feature provides three different types of information.

1. **The function registry**  
   Functions within the config file are registered within [spaCy's registry system](https://spacy.io/api/top-level#registry). When one of these functions is hovered over, the feature will provide information about the function and its arguments, along with a link to the code for the function, if available.

2. **Resolving references to variables**  
   Variables are denoted in the config file as `${<variable-name>}`. When a variable is hovered over, the feature will provide the value of that variable specified in the config file.

3. **Section titles**  
   The config system is separated by sections such as `[training.batcher]` or `[components]`. When a section, such as "training" or "components", or subsection, such as "batcher", is hovered over, the feature will provide a description of it, if available.
